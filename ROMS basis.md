## Direction of u v w and omega

**Reference: Manual Section 3.4**  
Direction of u v is along S-coordinate. There is an angle of sigma-layer slope  with the "true" u v in the Cartesian Coordinate.
Direction of omega is perpendicular to the sigma-layer and is not exactly vertical. w is the "true" vertical velocity in Cartesian coordinate.
