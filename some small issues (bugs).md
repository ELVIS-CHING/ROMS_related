## Common issues for all versions

- note the reference time in all input â€œ\*.nc file and in the "\*.in" file
  
- varinfo.dat ( do not confuse the different versions)

- error when reading '*\*.in*'  
  This error may occurs when using the new PGI (nvfortran) compiler.

  ```bash
  vi *.in
  ```
  and past the following command  
  ```bash
   :set fileformat=unix
  ```

## ROMS37 version with bio module modification

- in one version code, "indx" should be "ibio" in fennel.h of line 1726, 1740, and 1741  

## ROMS32 version with bio module modification

- must define the diagnostic output
  
- 'NDIA' in '*.in' file must be a nonzero value error  
  >   forrtl: severe (71): integer divide by zero

- 'RIVER_OM' : if you cannot undef this mode
  >   ROMS/Unility/inp_par.F: 3764 lost ifdef RIVER_OM

- in a version with module "RIVER_OM" added, the following code is reapted in Line 1686 and 1871, the latter one should be deleted  
```fortran
Bio(i,1,indx)=Bio(i,1,indx)+cff1_wc
```
